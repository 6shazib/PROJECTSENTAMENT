Define Objectives and Requirements

Identify the specific goals of the bot (e.g., trading stocks, cryptocurrencies).
Determine the data sources for sentiment analysis (e.g., Twitter, news sites).
Outline the decision-making process for the bot (e.g., buy, sell, hold criteria).







GOALS:
Functionality. 80% profitable or right on those trades. 



Biotech stock sentiment analysis
Gather shorted stock amount
Gather internet sentiment
Gather price action

	We need:
Short data
Sentiment analysis (google callouts, yahoo news)
Price action and date


DETERMINING DATA SOURCES:
Twitter. Google Alerts. Individual training sources: To be found.


DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR THE BOT: 
It should take short-interest in a stock, it should take the market sentiment into account. It should buy, sell, hold.
