Define Objectives and Requirements

Identify the specific goals of the bot (e.g., trading stocks, cryptocurrencies).
Determine the data sources for sentiment analysis (e.g., Twitter, news sites).
Outline the decision-making process for the bot (e.g., buy, sell, hold criteria).







GOALS:
Functionality. 80% profitable or right on those trades. 



Biotech stock sentiment analysis
Gather shorted stock amount
Gather internet sentiment
Gather price action

	We need:
Short data
Sentiment analysis (google callouts, yahoo news)
Price action and date


DETERMINING DATA SOURCES:
Twitter. Google Alerts. Individual training sources: To be found.


DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR THE BOT: 
It should take short-interest in a stock, it should take the market sentiment into account. It should buy, sell, hold. 
















Gather Data

Collect historical price data for the assets you are interested in.
Gather sentiment data from social media, news, and other relevant sources.


Preprocess Data

Clean and preprocess price data.
Clean and preprocess text data for sentiment analysis.


Sentiment Analysis

Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment.
Train a sentiment analysis model or use pre-trained models.


Develop Trading Algorithm

Combine sentiment analysis results with historical price data.
Develop trading rules and strategies based on combined data.


Backtesting

Test your trading algorithm on historical data to evaluate its performance.
Refine the algorithm based on backtesting results.


Implement the Trading Bot

Integrate the sentiment analysis and trading algorithm into a bot.
Connect the bot to a brokerage or trading platform.


Deploy and Monitor

Deploy the bot in a live trading environment.
Continuously monitor its performance and make adjustments as needed.
